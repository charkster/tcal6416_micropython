This IO expander has 16 GPIO with a separate I2C interface voltage and separate IO voltage. The interface voltage ranges from 1.08V to 3.6V and the IO voltage also ranges from 1.08V to 3.6V. This IO expander also has integrated pull-ups and pull-downs for all IOs. A nice IO expander for modern systems.
